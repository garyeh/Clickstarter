## Styling & Seed Data

Site layout and styling is written in SCSS and located in the `/app/assets/stylesheets` directory. Flex boxes were a major help in the design process. Video playlists are embedded from youtube, all images used are from either unsplash.com, pexels.com, another CC0 designated source, or copyright Katarina Rossi. Waterlogue, Prisma, and Photoshop were used to emulate artwork. Major fonts used include Lato, Open Sans, and Bromello for the logo and decorative touches.
